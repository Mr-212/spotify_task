#Spotify Task
- This is 8-9 step test task followed by task descriptin and visuals by figama design.
- Onboarding and spotify artist tables is created.
- Data is being saved in tables and summary can be viewd at the end.
- on adress page both country and adreess are being fetched from free open API's(sometimes the adress API took time and cause delayed response).
- Artist can be fetched by name or artist URL.
- Spotify authentication and adress API's are being handled by service classes at namespace App\Services;


#Livewire Components
- I followed each component for each screen and navigation between handled by next and previous methods on each component.
- The routes and associated components can be found in rputes.web.php.
- Spotify auth callback is handled by SpoityfyAuthCintroller.


#Veridict
- I have tested and it works fine.
- It may not have all perfect but it's enough to asseess abilities of developer.



#Comments
